Certainly! Let’s simplify the steps and make sure the environment variables are set in a way that’s easier to follow. Here’s a different approach:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create the Python Script**: Modify the script to read the JSON data from a variable and write environment variables to a file.
2. **Modify the Dockerfile**: Ensure the Dockerfile captures and uses these environment variables.

#### 1. Create the Python Script

Here’s an example Python script named `set_env_vars.py` that reads JSON data from a variable and writes the environment variables to a file:

```python
import os
import json

# JSON data stored in a variable
json_data = '''
{
    "KEY1": "value1",
    "KEY2": "value2"
}
'''

def write_env_vars_to_file(json_str, file_path):
    data = json.loads(json_str)
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        for key, value in data.items():
            file.write(f"{key}={value}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    output_file = 'env_vars.sh'
    write_env_vars_to_file(json_data, output_file)
```

This script reads the JSON data and writes each key-value pair to a file (`env_vars.sh`) in the format `KEY=value`.

#### 2. Modify the Dockerfile

Here’s how you can modify your Dockerfile to use this script and set the environment variables:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Install any necessary dependencies
RUN pip install requests

# Copy the Python script into the container
COPY set_env_vars.py /usr/src/app/set_env_vars.py

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Run the Python script to set environment variables and write them to a file
RUN python set_env_vars.py

# Source the environment variables from the file and export them
RUN set -a && . /usr/src/app/env_vars.sh && set +a

# Optional: Run a placeholder command or start your main application
CMD ["sh", "-c", "echo $KEY1 && echo $KEY2"]
```

### Explanation

1. **Copy Files**:
    - `set_env_vars.py` is copied into the Docker image.

2. **Run the Python Script**:
    - The `RUN` instruction runs the Python script, which generates the `env_vars.sh` file.

3. **Source the Environment Variables**:
    - The `RUN set -a && . /usr/src/app/env_vars.sh && set +a` command sources the environment variables from `env_vars.sh` and exports them.

4. **CMD Instruction**:
    - The `CMD` instruction runs a placeholder command to demonstrate that the environment variables are set. Replace it with your main application.

### Build and Run the Docker Image

Navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile` and `set_env_vars.py`, then run the following commands to build and run your Docker image:

```sh
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t json-env-docker .

# Run the Docker container
docker run --rm json-env-docker
```

### Notes

- **Security Considerations**: Ensure that sensitive information in your JSON variable is handled securely.
- **Portability**: The `env_vars.sh` file is sourced during the build, and the environment variables are made available at runtime.

By following these steps, you can read JSON data from a variable in a Python script, set environment variables, and use those values in a Dockerfile in a clear and understandable manner.
